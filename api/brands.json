Friedman&rsquo;s innovative designs and meticulous construction have made him legendary in the world of professional touring musicians.</p><p>Dave Friedman&rsquo;s extensive knowledge and pursuit of tonal superiority inspired him to develop his own series of production amplifiers under the name Friedman Amplification. Each Friedman amplifier is built in the U.S.A. to Dave&#39;s exacting standards using hand selected components. After a rigorous burn in process, Dave inspects, tubes, plays and signs the chase of every amplifier before shipping them to us.</p><p>At Tone Temple we are big fans of the Friedman BE-100, an amp that is one of the most talked about designs for the past few years and our benchmark amplifier. We are also very excited about the new Runt 20 which has an internal load and cab-simulated XLR output, perfect for recording silently at home.

It allows the user to access up to 36 different tunings at the touch of a button.</p><p>The TronicalTune system consists of three main components. First, there’s a set of motorized machine heads called RoboHeads. From the front of the headstock, these look like conventional locking tuners. Second, there’s a rectangular box adorned with LEDs, which contains the battery and the brains of the system. And third, there’s a black plate which sits flush against the back of the headstock, with the machine heads passing through it. </p><p>While the ‘brain’ is common to all Tronical configurations. The weight of the system is no more than a set of locking tuners. The internal Lithium-Polymer battery lasts for up to 300 tunings on just one charge and If the system is switched off you can always tune by hand!</p>",

      "content": "<p>At Tone Temple we believe there is no better hum cancelling system for single coil pickups than the Illitch products. Ilitch Chiliachki, a former design engineer for Seymour Duncan, founded Illitch Electronics in 2004 and one year later patented his hum cancelling technology for electric guitar single coil pickups and licensed it to Suhr Guitars. In 2011 both companies went their separate ways and Ilitch Electronics expanded his line of Hum cancelling products to cover the most popular guitar models and single coil pickup combinations. Contact us to find out which system will best suit your guitar.</p>",
